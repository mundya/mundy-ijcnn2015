    Building and simulating neural systems is a promising avenue in our search
    for understanding how the brain may work and for how neural and cognitive
    systems may be employed to tackle engineering problems.  The Neural
    Engineering Framework (NEF) is an interesting hypothesis about how such
    systems may be constructed -- recently being used to build the world's
    first functional brain model.  However, while the NEF and its related
    software tool (Nengo) simplify the design of complex neural networks their
    simulation is still computationally expensive -- often running far slower
    than biological real-time and scaling very poorly on standard compute
    hardware: problems the SpiNNaker neuromorphic simulator was designed to
    solve. In this paper we (1) argue that the spiking model of computation
    used in writing software for SpiNNaker maps poorly to the task of
    simulating models built using the NEF, and (2) provide and evaluate an
    alternative simulation scheme which overcomes the memory and communication
    challenges posed by the NEF.

  \section{Introduction}

  For a given power budget two factors limit the simulation of neural networks
  on any computing platform: scale and time.  In principle any scale of network
  may be simulated but as scale increases simulation time follows.  Conversely,
  if the simulation time is limited (for example, if biological real-time is
  necessary) then only a limited scale of network may be simulated.
  Specialised ``neuromorphic'' hardware tries to avoid these constraints by
  parallelising and distributing computational effort and relying on dense
  interconnection of the computing elements. The SpiNNaker platform
  \parencite{Furber2014} is one of a range of neuromorphic simulators
  (including NeuroGrid \parencite{}, FACETS \parencite{} and lately TrueNorth
  \parencite{}) which should benefit investigators of embodied cognition and
  researchers of large neural models alike by enabling scalable, rapid
  simulation of large-scale neural networks.

  The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) \parencite{Eliasmith2004} is a
  hypothesis about how neurons may act to encode the abstract mathematical
  constructs, such as scalars and vectors, that we often use in modelling the
  real world.  Its successes so far include the Spaun model of cognition
  \parencite{Eliasmith2012} and applications in embedded robotics (e.g.,
  \parencite{Stewart2015ip}).  As with all neural systems the NEF has proven
  costly to simulate, simulations of the Spaun model typically took
  \SI{2.5}{\hour} of simulation time for \SI{1}{\second} of simulation
  \parencite[\S V]{Stewart2014}.  However, unlike the vast majority of neural
  networks -- such as those specified using the PyNN language
  \parencite{Davison2008} -- models built using the NEF typically have high
  firing rates (around \SIrange{200}{400}{\hertz} when saturated) and dense
  synaptic matrices.  The former presents a significant communication cost to
  any specialised neuromorphic hardware and the latter requires that large
  amounts of memory be used to represent the neural network with all the
  associated costs of transferring large blocks of data that implies.

  In this paper we:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item argue that due to these characteristics of the NEF the
      existing solutions and algorithms used to simulate neural networks on
      SpiNNaker will not satisfactorily scale to Spaun-like models,

    \item detail a method by which features of the NEF may be used to reduce
      the communication and memory costs associated with its simulation.
      
  \end{enumerate}
  The result is a model of computation similar to the data-flow computer which
  we hope to use in running the full Spaun model in biological real-time.

  \section{Background}

  In this section we briefly discuss the SpiNNaker platform and how neural
  networks are currently simulated on it, how well the Neural Engineering
  Framework (NEF) could map to SpiNNaker using this scheme, and how the NEF
  works to specify and build neural networks and why these networks

  \subsection{The SpiNNaker platform}

  The SpiNNaker (spiking neural network architecture) platform is a massively
  parallel architecture designed to simulate neural networks.  A SpiNNaker
  machine is constructed from a number of interconnected SpiNNaker chips.  The
  chip-level interconnection network forms a toroidal, triangular mesh such
  that each chip is directly connected to six immediate neighbours.  18 ARM
  processing cores connected, via a network-on-chip, to each other and the
  external network through a single router make up each chip.  A single core
  has access to a small amount of local data and instruction memory
  (\SI{64}{\kibi\byte} of data tightly-coupled memory and \SI{32}{\kibi\byte}
  of instruction tightly-coupled memory) and a share of \SI{128}{\mebi\byte}
  SDRAM, which is accessible with some delay.

  SpiNNaker is an event-driven message-passing computing architecture.  The
  software running on a core may transmit packets to other processing cores to
  indicate the occurrence of events or to share data.  A packet consists of a
  \SI{32}{\bit} key -- which is used to direct the packet around the network --
  and, optionally, a \SI{32}{\bit} data payload.  When a packet reaches a
  router the key is inspected to determine to which (if any) of the 18
  processors and six external links attached to the router it should be
  forwarded.  On receipt of a packet a core executes a \textit{callback}
  function which may inspect the packet and schedule further execution as
  required.

  \subsection{Simulating neural nets on SpiNNaker}

  When simulating neural nets on a SpiNNaker machine each core is allocated a
  number (up to a few hundred) of point neurons.  The (usually sparse) synaptic
  weight matrices for connections into these neurons are stored in compressed
  sparse row form in the portion of SDRAM allocated to the core.  The spiking
  of a neuron will cause a packet to be transmitted with a key which uniquely
  identifies the neuron and no payload.  This packet will be routed across the
  network fabric to all processing cores which are simulating neurons that have
  synapses originating from the firing neuron.  On receipt of a ``spike''
  packet a core will look up the appropriate synaptic weights in SDRAM and will
  include a contribution from the spike in the input currents of appropriate
  receiving neurons.

  There are three primary constraints to the number of neurons that may be
  simulated on a single processing core:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The amount of memory required to store the synaptic weight matrices
      must fit within the space available to the core.
    \item The number of packets likely to be transmitted by the core should not
      lead to saturation of the interconnection network.
    \item There must be sufficient time for the core to look up synaptic
      strengths for all received packets during one simulation time-step.
  \end{enumerate}

  These constraints may be met by either allocating fewer neurons to each
  processing core or by increasing the processing time used for each simulation
  time-step.
  
  In practice there are limits to the number of processors and the amount of
  time that are available (though one aim of the SpiNNaker project is to build
  a machine consisting of one million cores).  Hard time constraints are
  necessary when SpiNNaker is required to run in biological real-time, as it is
  in experiments with other neuromorphic hardware.  Processor constraints are
  present for those with access to only small SpiNNaker machines.  At some
  point it is necessary to ensure that efficient use is made of the machine
  with regard to both time and processor usage.

  To a first approximation the first constraint is that the synaptic matrices
  for a core's neurons must fit within $\frac{128}{16} = \SI{8}{\mebi\byte}$.
  The interconnection network was designed around an expectation that each core
  would simulate around \num{1000} neurons firing at roughly \SI{10}{\hertz}
  and that consequently the second constraint is that when simulating on a
  millisecond time-step in biological real-time each core is expected to
  transmit around 10 spikes per time-step.  The third constraint is given by
  \textcite[\S III.C]{Sharp2013} as around \num{5000} spikes per millisecond.

  It should be noted that time is also a factor \textit{prior} to the start of
  any simulation.  All data required by the SpiNNaker machine during simulation
  must be transmitted to it across ethernet, consequently the more data
  required on the machine the greater the time required to prepare it for
  simulation.  \textcite{Sharp2013} note that this can take a significant
  period of time and that this is undesirable if a real-time simulator is
  desired.
