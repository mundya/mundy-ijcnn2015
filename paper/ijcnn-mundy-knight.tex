    Building and simulating neural systems is a promising avenue in our search
    for understanding how the brain may work and for how neural and cognitive
    systems may be employed to tackle engineering problems. The Neural
    Engineering Framework (NEF) is an interesting hypothesis about how such
    systems may be constructed and has recently being used to build the world's
    first functional brain model. However, while the NEF simplifies the design 
    of complex neural networks, simulating these using standard computer 
    hardware is still computationally expensive -- often running far slower
    than biological real-time and scaling very poorly: problems the SpiNNaker 
    neuromorphic simulator was designed to solve. In this paper we (1) argue 
    that employing the model of computation used for simulating general purpose 
    spiking neural networks on SpiNNaker for NEF models is sub-optimal, and (2) 
    provide and evaluate an alternative simulation scheme which overcomes the 
    memory and communication challenges posed by the NEF.

  \section{Introduction}

  For a given power budget, two factors limit the simulation of neural networks
  on any computing platform: scale and time. In principle any scale of network
  may be simulated but as scale increases simulation time follows. Conversely,
  if the simulation time is limited (for example, if biological real-time is
  necessary) then only a limited scale of network may be simulated.
  Specialised ``neuromorphic'' hardware tries to avoid these constraints by
  parallelising and distributing computational effort and relying on dense
  interconnection of the computing elements. The SpiNNaker platform
  \parencite{Furber2014} is one of a range of neuromorphic simulators
  (including NeuroGrid \parencite{}, FACETS \parencite{} and lately TrueNorth
  \parencite{}) which should benefit investigators of embodied cognition and
  researchers of large neural models alike by enabling scalable, rapid
  simulation of large-scale neural networks.

  The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) \parencite{Eliasmith2004} is a
  hypothesis about how neurons may act to encode the abstract mathematical
  constructs, such as scalars and vectors, that we often use in modelling the
  real world. Its successes so far include the Spaun model of cognition
  \parencite{Eliasmith2012} and applications in embedded robotics (e.g.,
  \parencite{Stewart2015ip}). As with all neural systems, the NEF has proven
  costly to simulate with simulations of the Spaun model typically taking
  \SI{2.5}{\hour} of simulation time for \SI{1}{\second} of simulation
  \parencite[\S V]{Stewart2014}. Two aspects of NEF networks that make them 
  particularily costly to simulate are the high firing rates of individual 
  neurons (around \SIrange{200}{400}{\hertz} when saturated) and the dense 
  synaptic matrices used to connect neuronal populations. The former 
  presents a significant communication cost to any specialised neuromorphic 
  hardware and the latter requires that large amounts of memory be used to 
  represent the neural network with all the associated costs of transferring 
  large blocks of data that implies.

  In this paper we:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item argue that due to these properties of the NEF, the
      existing solutions and algorithms used to simulate neural networks on
      SpiNNaker will not satisfactorily scale to Spaun-like models,
    \item detail a method by which features of the NEF may be used to reduce
      the communication and memory costs associated with its simulation.
  \end{enumerate}

  The result is a model of computation similar to the data-flow computer which
  we hope to use in running the full Spaun model in biological real-time.

  \section{Background}

  In this section we briefly discuss the SpiNNaker platform and how neural
  networks are currently simulated on it, how well the Neural Engineering
  Framework (NEF) could map to SpiNNaker using this scheme, and how the NEF
  works to specify and build neural networks and why these networks

  \subsection{The SpiNNaker platform}
  The SpiNNaker platform is a massively parallel architecture designed to 
  simulate neural networks. A SpiNNaker machine is constructed from a number 
  of SpiNNaker chips, each connected to their six immediate neighbours using a 
  chip-level interconnection network with a toroidal, triangular mesh 
  topology. Each SpiNNaker chip contains 18 ARM processing cores connected, via 
  a network-on-chip, to each other and the external network through a 
  multicast router. Each core has two small tightly-coupled memories: 
  \SI{32}{\kibi\byte} for instructions~(ITCM) and \SI{64}{\kibi\byte} for 
  data~(DTCM) and shares \SI{128}{\mebi\byte} of off-chip SDRAM with the other 
  cores on the SpiNNaker chip.

  SpiNNaker is an event-driven message-passing computing architecture. The
  software running on a core may transmit packets to other processing cores to
  indicate the occurrence of events or to share data. A packet consists of a
  \SI{32}{\bit} key -- which is used to direct the packet around the network --
  and, optionally, a \SI{32}{\bit} data payload. When a packet reaches a
  router the key is inspected to determine to which (if any) of the 18
  processors and six external links attached to the router it should be
  forwarded. On receipt of a packet a core executes a \textit{callback}
  function which may inspect the packet and schedule further execution as
  required.

  \subsection{Simulating neural nets on SpiNNaker}

  When simulating neural nets on a SpiNNaker machine, each core is responsible
  for simulating a number (in the order of a few hundred) of point neurons. 
  When one of these neuron spikes, it transmits a packet whose key uniquely 
  identifies the neuron (for this it requires no payload). This ``spike'' 
  packet is then routed across the network fabric to the processing cores 
  responsible for simulating each of the neurons that are synaptically 
  connected to the firing neuron. On receipt of a ``spike'' packet, a core 
  retrieves the ``row'' of the connectivity matrix associated with the firing 
  neuron from SDRAM. Each of these rows describes the synaptic weights and 
  delays associated with the connections between the firing neuron and those 
  simulated on the core. Once a row is retrived, the weights are inserted into 
  an input ring-buffer where they remain until the synaptic delay has elapsed 
  and they are used to calculate the neuronal input current.

  There are three primary constraints to the number of neurons that may be
  simulated on a single processing core:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The amount of memory required to store the synaptic weight matrices
      must fit within the space available to the core.
    \item The number of packets likely to be transmitted by the core should not
      lead to saturation of the interconnection network.
    \item As \textcite{Sharp2013} discuss, the majority of processing time is spent in the synaptic processing pipeline so there must be sufficient time for the core to process all incoming `spike' packets; and retrieve and process the synaptic rows during one simulation time-step.
  \end{enumerate}

  These constraints may be met by either allocating fewer neurons to each
  processing core or by increasing the processing time used for each simulation
  time-step.
  
  In practice there are limits to the number of processors and the amount of
  time that are available (though one aim of the SpiNNaker project is to build
  a machine consisting of one million cores). Hard time constraints are
  necessary when SpiNNaker is required to run in biological real-time, as it is
  in experiments with other neuromorphic hardware. Processor constraints are
  present for those with access to only small SpiNNaker machines. At some
  point it is necessary to ensure that efficient use is made of the machine
  with regard to both time and processor usage.

  To a first approximation the first constraint is that the synaptic matrices
  for a core's neurons must fit within $\frac{128}{16} = \SI{8}{\mebi\byte}$.
  The interconnection network was designed around an expectation that each core
  would simulate around \num{1000} neurons firing at roughly \SI{10}{\hertz}
  and that consequently the second constraint is that when simulating on a
  millisecond time-step in biological real-time each core is expected to
  transmit around 10 spikes per time-step. The third constraint is given by
  \textcite[\S III.C]{Sharp2013} as around \num{5000} spikes per millisecond.

  It should be noted that time is also a factor \textit{prior} to the start of
  any simulation. All data required by the SpiNNaker machine during simulation
  must be transmitted to it across ethernet, consequently the more data
  required on the machine the greater the time required to prepare it for
  simulation. \textcite{Sharp2013} note that this can take a significant
  period of time and that this is undesirable if a real-time simulator is
  desired.
